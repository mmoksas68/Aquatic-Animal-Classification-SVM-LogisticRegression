<h1>Aquatic Animal Classification using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines</h1>
<p>This project is CS-464 Introduction to Machine Learning Spring 2020 Homework 2</p>

This homework is implemented in MATLAB. There are 4 matlab scripts:

q1_logistic_regression.m
q1_svm_subclass.m
q1_svm_superclass.m
q2_pca_analysis.m

To run each scripts, the script should be in the same folder as the data provided for hw2.
Then you can just Run (F5) the program to execute. It takes some time to execute the program (might change depending on the pc specs).

Alternatively, I splitted the scripts into sections and write comments regarding what that section is about.
You can run each section separetaly. Personally, I believe this way it will be easier to examine codes.

The homework is implemented in Matlab r2019b.Therefore some functions to read the data might not be compatible with 
the earlier versions. Please try to execute the programs using Matlab r2019b.
